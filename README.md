### It allows you to find into a food list that suits you according to you fitness goals. It is developed in 2 tab, the first one, is the calculator where you can set the inputs such as body fat, body weight, among others to get outputs like calories that are made according nutritional formulas that will contribute with your goal (lose fat or gain muscle)  on what you should consume. 


### Finally, the second tab contains one text input to find any food you wish to eat, and then at box located next to it you will get the total foods thar are in that category or kind of food (eg. Pig, pig with rice, pig with salad, and so on).
