### It allows you to find into a food list what suits you according to you fitness goals. So, is developed in 2 tabs. The first one is the calculator where you set the #### inputs such as body fat, body weight, among others. To get outputs like calories that according to you goal (lose fat or gain muscle)  you should consume. 


### and the second tab contains one text input to fin any food you wish to eat, and then at box located next to it you will get the total foods thar are in that category ### or kind of food (eg. Pig, pig with rice, pig with salas, and so on).
### Once you have selected one in the dropdown list you will find the food nutritional information. And then you will verfiy if it fits your macros (Carbs, protein and fat).


### The food information was web scraped and the script is in the repository called nutritrional food storage in my Github account.
